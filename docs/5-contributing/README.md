# Opensource & contributions

One of the many advantages of open source software is the fact that everyone can contribute to its development. If you don't have any programming experience, but you would like to contribute to the YetiForce system, you can always help us develop our documentation or translate the language files. If you are a developer who would like to contribute to YetiForce, you can send us your comments regarding the code, bug fixes, or even entire functionalities.

:::tip

Remember that system testing and bug reporting is also considered contribution to the development of the system, because if we don't know that there is a bug, we can't fix it.

## How to contribute

- **add documentation** - You can help us develop our documentation by adding new articles or fixing any errors you found in the ones that we already posted. To add a new article you need to create a new file [here](https://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForceDoc/tree/main/docs), and to fix an existing one simply scroll down to the end of the article and click `Edit`.
- **submit translations** - You can submit your translations via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/yetiforcecrm) - a platform that allows the Community to translate software into any language.
- **send pull requests** - You can send us bug fixes, modifications, or entire functionalities using [Pull Requests](https://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForceCRM/pulls). Sending Pull Requests requires signing a CLA (Contributor License Agreement). This document protects you and our company from false copyright claims concerning the code. If we don't receive a signed CLA from you, we will unfortunately not be able to accept your Pull Requests.

- **test the software and report bugs** - You can test our [development version](https://gitdeveloper.yetiforce.com/index.php?module=Users&view=Login) and report all problems you find using the [Issues tab](https://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForceCRM/issues) in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/YetiForceCompany/YetiForceCRM).
